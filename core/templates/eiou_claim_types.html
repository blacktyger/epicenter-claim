                    EPIC-002 balance does not reflect any deposit to Vitex done after 12 March.

                    Balances on your account are compared in order to calculate the EIOU value.
                    Each case must be manually investigated to validate Mimblewimble transactions
                    correlated to your account.

                    Epic Cash coins purchased from the hacker account on
                    Vitex after 12 March do not exist as these coins were
                    produced illegitimately by the hacker.
                    There is no option to claim the spoofed coins.

                    The USD value calculation of trades after 12 March is
                    based on the EPIC/BTC and BTC/USD price when executed.
                    This calculation represents the loss to be compensated
                    with EIOU tokens.

                    Mining compensation requires evidence of losses incurred
                    by the miner. Screenshots, receipts (rented mining power,
                    electric bills, etc), log files, etc may all be considered
                    in analysis.  The community volunteer team will fact check
                    submissions and may ask further questions.
